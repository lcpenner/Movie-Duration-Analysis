# Movie-Duration-Analysis

This program is used to perform an analysis on whether movie durations have gone down over time. 
Upon completing the analysis, there is no indication that movie durations are going down.

The program reads in Netflix data from a CSV. The data is then filtered and displayed using scatter plots.

The program uses pandas and matplotlib to manipulate and display the data.
