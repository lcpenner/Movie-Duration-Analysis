# Movie-Duration-Analysis

This program is used to perform an analysis on whether movie durations have gone down over time. The end result is inconclusive.

The program reads in Netflix data from a CSV. The data is then filtered and sliced prior to displaying scatter plot visualizations.

The program uses pandas and matplotlib to manipulate and display the data.
